Each time you call `testhook()`, it creates a **completely new and independent state**. This is because `testhook()` uses React's `useState`, which initializes a separate state instance for every invocation of the hook.

In your code:

```javascript
let [test, settest] = testhook();
let [test1, settest1] = testhook();
```

- `test` and `settest` refer to one state instance.
- `test1` and `settest1` refer to another, completely separate state instance.

### What happens when you modify the states?
- If you call `settest((prev) => prev + 1)`, only the state associated with `test` will update.
- If you call `settest1((prev) => prev + 1)`, only the state associated with `test1` will update.

### Do the states overlap?
No, the states do **not overlap**. They are entirely independent because each invocation of `testhook()` calls `useState()` separately, and `useState()` creates isolated state variables for that specific invocation.

### Your Code Execution:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  settest1((prev) => prev + 1);
  settest((prev) => {
    return prev + 1;
  });
}, []);
```

Hereâ€™s what happens step by step:
1. `settest1((prev) => prev + 1)` updates only `test1` state.
2. `settest((prev) => prev + 1)` updates only `test` state.

The `console.log` statements after the `useEffect` will log the final updated values, but these updates will not overlap between `test` and `test1`.

### Key Takeaway:
The states are **completely separate**. Calling the custom `testhook` multiple times results in independent state variables. Changing one will not affect the other.
